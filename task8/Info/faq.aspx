         <p class="text"><b>How many books do Teddy Books publish a year?</b><br />
    This year, we will publish just over 100 books. Approximately 65% of our list this year
    has been dedicated to our range of children's books - picture books (lower primary), Young Adult fiction 
    (ages 12-16), plus our Takeaways series (aimed at ages 8-12), our Crime Waves series(crime fiction aimed at 
    ages 10-14) and our all new Animal series (aimed at ages 6-8). The remaining 35% is our adult list, featuring
    categories such as Indoor and Outdoor Design, Health and Relationships, Business, and Personal Development.
    Unfortunately we do not publish adult fiction or poetry of any kind.<br /><br />
        
    <b>Does Teddy Books accept unsolicited manuscripts?</b><br />
    Teddy Books does accept manuscripts that are 'unsolicited' - submissions that are not made through a literary 
    agent. We ask that if you are thinking of submitting something to us, please follow the guidelines that can be 
    found in the 'guidelines for authors' section before sending anything to us.<br /><br /></p>
